# Character Mechanics Guide

Every class in Spellstorm has a distinct combat identity. Some charge devastating shots, others chain rapid combos, and others tether to enemies for sustained damage. This guide covers the unique combat mechanics across all 24 classes so you know what to expect when you pick up a new character.

Understanding your class's mechanics is the difference between holding LMB and actually playing well. Each mechanic rewards a specific kind of skill — patience, timing, positioning, or aggression — and the best players learn to lean into what their class does best.

## Combat Mechanics Overview

Spellstorm classes draw from 8 categories of combat mechanics. Most classes use one or two; some use none and play as traditional casters or fighters.

### Channeled Casting
Hold to build power. Your movement slows while channeling, but the longer you hold, the more damage you deal. Full channels hit significantly harder than quick taps. Taking a big hit can break your channel early.

### Charge-Up Attacks
Hold your attack button to charge, then release to fire. A quick tap fires a weak shot; a full charge unleashes a devastating blast with bonus effects like piercing or larger explosions. You move slower while charging.

### Combo Chains
Multi-hit sequences where each successive hit deals more damage. Land your hits within the timeout window to keep the chain going. The final hit in a combo always has a special bonus effect like a stun or area explosion.

### Stance Switching
Toggle between two complete spell sets — typically a ranged form and a melee form. Switching grants a brief damage buff, rewarding players who flow between forms rather than staying in one.

### Tether Mechanics
Connect to an enemy and maintain proximity for sustained damage or healing. If you hold the tether for its full duration, you are rewarded with a powerful burst effect like a stun or damage spike.

### Positional Bonuses
You deal more damage or gain defensive benefits by standing in specific locations — near arena pillars, close to enemies, or inside your own zones. These mechanics reward smart positioning over constant movement.

### Mark and Detonate
Apply marks with one ability, then detonate them with another for burst damage. Marks stack, and detonation damage scales with how many marks you have applied. This creates a setup-then-payoff rhythm.

### Alternative Resources *(Coming Soon)*
Some classes are designed to replace standard mana with unique resource systems — Rage, Heat, or Ammo — that change how you manage your casting economy. These systems are not yet in the game.

## Class Reference

### Channeled Casting Classes

#### Stormcaller
*Channeled lightning striker who builds up static and pops it in a continuous rhythm.*

| Mechanic | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Channeled Casting** | **Lightning** (LMB) — sustained beam, 1.5s channel, movement slowed 50%. Damage builds from 1x to 2.5x at full channel. Breaks if you take 3+ damage in a single hit. |
| **Auto-Detonate** | Beam applies static on hit (up to 3 stacks). When the beam hits an enemy already at max stacks, the marks auto-detonate for bonus damage and the stacks clear — beam rebuilds from scratch. Rhythm: build (3 hits) → pop → build → pop. |
| **Defense Field** | **Discharge** (RMB) — hold to channel a 180-radius static dome around yourself for up to 2.5s. On activation deals **10 dmg + 2s stun** to every enemy inside and detonates static marks (+3 dmg, +0.5s stun per stack). While held, destroys incoming enemy projectiles AND re-stuns any enemy inside the field every 0.2s — anything that tries to walk in gets pinned the moment it crosses the boundary. Movement slowed to 60%. Breaks if you take 5+ damage in a single hit. 22 mana, 5s cd. |
| **Reposition** | **Storm Step** (Q) — short-range blink (180 units, 2.5s cd) to break line of sight or escape a cluster. |
| **Ultimate** | **Thunder God** (Space) — 5s transformation. Lightning becomes instant (no channel needed), every hit auto-detonates, Storm Step cooldown removed, move speed +50%. |

**Passive — Feedback Loop:** Each auto-detonation during a channel refunds 0.3s of Storm Step cooldown and adds +5% damage to the current channel (stacks up to +50%). Sustained focus on priority targets snowballs, and your teleport stays ready.

**Tip:** The core loop is beam → auto-pop → Storm Step → beam again. If you get surrounded, press Q Discharge to cash in every enemy you've been marking, then Storm Step away. In co-op, pair Discharge with an ally's AoE setup — your marks paint the cluster, Q finishes it. Hold Thunder God for dense waves where the instant-detonate + free teleport lets you melt a whole screen.

---

### Charge-Up Classes

#### Ranger
*Precise marksman with charged power shots and pillar-based positioning.*

| Mechanic | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Charge-Up** | **Power Shot** (LMB) — 1.2s charge, movement slowed 50%. Quick taps deal minimal damage; a full charge hits for up to 4.5x and gains extra piercing. |
| **Positional Bonus** | Deal 1.5x damage when standing near arena pillars (within 100 units). |

**Passive — Eagle Eye:** Primary attack range increased by 40%. Consecutive hits build Focus — your 3rd and subsequent hits crit.

**Tip:** Position yourself near a pillar, charge your Power Shot fully, and release into a cluster. The pillar bonus stacks with the charge bonus for massive single shots. Build Focus with quick taps, then swap to full charges for crits.

---

#### Warlock
*High-risk dark caster who trades health for devastating charged blasts.*

| Mechanic | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Charge-Up** | **Shadow Bolt** (LMB) — 0.8s charge, movement slowed 50%. Scales from moderate to massive damage at full charge, and gains a larger explosion radius. |

**Passive — Dark Pact:** Casting refunds 30% mana but costs 1 HP. Every spell is a gamble — you sustain your mana by burning your health.

**Tip:** The short charge time means you can weave charged shots more frequently than other charge-up classes. Pair with Drain Life (RMB) to recover the health your passive burns. Full charges in tight groups are devastating thanks to the expanded blast radius.

---

#### Cannoneer
*Siege artillery with slow, powerful shots that reward accuracy and patience.*

| Mechanic | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Charge-Up** | **Power Shot** (LMB) — 1.0s charge, movement slowed 40%. Scales from baseline to a devastating 8x damage at full charge, plus a larger explosion radius. |

**Passive — Heavy Caliber:** Every 4th shot deals double damage with double explosion radius. Count your shots — the 4th is your big payoff.

**Tip:** The Cannoneer hits harder per shot than any other class but fires slowly. Every shot matters. Charge fully, aim carefully, and time your 4th shot for the densest cluster. Use Caltrops (Q) and Concussive Shell (RMB) to control enemy movement so they walk into your killzone.

---

### Combo Chain Classes

#### Monk
*Lightning-fast martial artist with a three-hit combo and evasion.*

| Mechanic | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Combo Chain** | **Chi Combo** (LMB) — 3-hit chain with a 1.5s timeout between hits. Damage ramps from weak to strong, and the final hit stuns nearby enemies plus explodes in an area burst. |

**Passive — Inner Peace:** 25% chance to dodge attacks. Deal 50% bonus damage when attacking from behind.

**Tip:** Stay in rhythm — land all three hits within the timeout to reach the powerful finisher. Use Flying Kick (RMB) to close distance, then immediately begin your combo chain. The stun on the 3rd hit gives you a free window to reposition or start another chain.

---

#### Knight
*Armored tank with a two-hit shield bash combo.*

| Mechanic | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Combo Chain** | **Shield Combo** (RMB) — 2-hit chain with a 2.0s timeout. The first hit deals standard damage; the second hit deals double and stuns the target for 1.0s. |

**Passive — Bulwark:** Take 25% less damage from all sources.

**Tip:** The Knight's combo is simple but powerful. The 2nd hit stun is one of the longest in the game — use it to lock down dangerous enemies like Wraiths or bosses. Charge in with Q, then immediately start your Shield Combo for a quick engage-to-stun sequence.

---

#### Berserker
*Raging melee brawler who gets stronger as health drops and enemies close in.*

| Mechanic | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Combo Chain** | **Axe Combo** (LMB) — 3-hit chain with a 2.0s timeout. Damage ramps with each swing, and the final hit releases an area explosion. |
| **Positional Bonus** | Deal 30% bonus damage when within close range of enemies (80 units). Nearby enemies also take damage from your passive aura. |

**Passive — Fury:** Below 50% HP, you gain massively increased damage and speed plus lifesteal. Enemies standing close to you take constant aura damage and you deal bonus damage to them.

**Tip:** The Berserker wants to be surrounded. Your aura damages nearby enemies, your positional bonus rewards close range, and your Fury passive makes you a monster at low health. Leap Slam into packs, chain your Axe Combo, and let the final hit's explosion clear everything around you.

---

#### Bladecaller
*Kill-chaining assassin who dashes through enemies and builds momentum with each kill.*

| Mechanic | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Combo Chain** | **Blade Chain** (LMB) — 4-hit chain with a 1.8s timeout. Damage escalates dramatically across four strikes, and the final hit explodes in an area burst with a stun. The longest combo chain in the game. |

**Passive — Kill Rush:** Kills within 1.5s of using Shadow Step (RMB) reset its cooldown. Each kill grants stacking movement speed for 3s (up to 3 stacks). Double damage when attacking from behind.

**Tip:** The Bladecaller is a chain-reaction class. Dash into a pack with Shadow Step, start your 4-hit combo, and if something dies, your dash resets. The optimal pattern is a zigzag through enemies — dash, combo, kill, dash again. If you fail to kill on a dive, you are stranded with no escape, so pick your engages carefully.

---

### Stance Switching Classes

#### Hexblade
*Hybrid caster-melee who switches between ranged hexes and blade-form executions.*

| Mechanic | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Stance Switching** | Press Space to toggle between **Caster form** (ranged spells, faster movement) and **Blade form** (melee attacks, slower but harder-hitting). 3.5s cooldown between switches. Switching grants a brief 1.5x damage buff for 1s. |
| **Mark and Detonate** | All abilities apply hex marks (passive). Hex-marked enemies take 25% more damage from all sources. At 3 stacks, they are also slowed. |

**Passive — Hex Mastery:** Hex-marked enemies take 25% increased damage from everyone. At 3 stacks, enemies are also slowed by 30%.

**Caster Form Spells:** Hex Bolt (LMB), Doom Mark (RMB), Void Zone (Q)
**Blade Form Spells:** Hex Slash (LMB), Shadow Leap (RMB), Whirlwind (Q)

**Tip:** Open in Caster form to apply hex marks at range, then switch to Blade form to execute slowed, debuffed targets up close. The switch itself gives you a damage spike — time it right before your burst. In co-op, staying in Caster form to mark targets for your ally can be just as effective as doing the executing yourself.

---

### Tether Classes

#### Necromancer
*Death mage who drains life through sustained tether connections.*

| Mechanic | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Tether** | **Life Siphon** (RMB) — Connect to an enemy within range 180. Deals sustained damage while healing you. Lasts 3s. Full-duration reward: a large burst of damage plus a heal. |

**Passive — Soul Harvest:** Kills heal you for a small amount.

**Tip:** Life Siphon is your sustain tool. Tether to a target and stay within range for the full 3 seconds to get the burst payoff. The healing keeps you alive in close quarters. Pair with Plague (Q) to slow enemies so they cannot break tether range.

---

#### Chronomancer
*Time mage who locks down enemies with tethers and slowing fields.*

| Mechanic | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Tether** | **Temporal Tether** (Q) — Connect to an enemy within range 200. Lasts 4s. Full-duration reward: a massive 2.5s stun on the target. |

**Passive — Haste Aura:** Nearby ally gains +15% movement speed.

**Tip:** Temporal Tether's reward is one of the longest stuns in the game. Use Temporal Field (RMB) to slow nearby enemies first, making it easier to maintain tether range. The 4-second tether is a commitment — plan your positioning before you connect.

---

#### Graviturge
*Gravity battle mage who thrives when surrounded by enemies.*

| Mechanic | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Tether** | **Event Horizon** (Q) — Connect to an enemy within range 200. Deals sustained damage and heals you. Lasts 3s. Full-duration reward: a 2.0s stun plus a burst of damage and healing. |

**Passive — Gravity Well:** Enemies within close range (80 units) take constant damage from your gravity field. Each nearby enemy also increases your mana regeneration.

**Tip:** Graviturge is the anti-kiting class. Everything in your kit rewards standing in the middle of the fight. Pull enemies in with Gravity Bolt (LMB) slow, drop a Singularity (RMB) zone at your feet, and tether the toughest enemy with Event Horizon. The more enemies around you, the faster your mana regenerates and the more damage your passive aura deals.

---

#### Soulbinder
*Spirit mage who tethers enemies and empowers allies.*

| Mechanic | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Tether** | **Soul Tether** (RMB) — Connect to an enemy within range 250 (the longest tether range in the game). Lasts 2s. Full-duration reward: a 1.5s stun. |

**Passive — Soul Bond:** Your primary attack marks enemies for 4s. Allies deal bonus damage to marked targets and heal on marked kills.

**Tip:** Soulbinder excels in co-op. Mark enemies with Soul Lash (LMB), tether priority targets to lock them down, and place Soul Surge (Q) to heal your ally. Your tether has the longest range, making it safer to maintain than other tether classes, but it is also shorter in duration — you must connect deliberately.

---

### Positional Bonus Classes

Positional bonuses appear as secondary mechanics on classes listed above. Here is a quick reference:

| Class | Bonus | Condition |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Ranger** | 1.5x damage | Stand near arena pillars (within 100 units) |
| **Architect** | 20% damage reduction + bonus mana regen | Stand near your own zones |
| **Berserker** | 30% bonus damage + aura damage to enemies | Stay within 80 units of enemies |

---

### Mark and Detonate Classes

Mark and Detonate appears as a secondary mechanic on some classes listed above. Here is a quick reference:

| Class | Mark Spell | Detonate Spell | Detonation Effect |
|-------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Cryomancer** | Frost Ray (LMB) applies frost marks | Freeze Breath (RMB) detonates | Burst damage per stack + stun + spread |
| **Stormcaller** | Ball Zap (RMB) applies static marks | Thunder (Q) detonates | Burst damage per stack + stun |
| **Paladin** | Smite (LMB) applies judgment marks | Consecrate (Q) detonates | Burst damage per stack + healing |
| **Hexblade** | Various abilities apply hex marks | Passive detonation | Marked enemies take +25% damage; 3 stacks slow |

---

### Traditional Playstyle Classes

These classes do not use anti-kiting mechanics. They play as straightforward casters or fighters, relying on their spell kits and passives for identity.

#### Pyromancer
*Fire burst dealer with explosions and burn damage.*

**Passive — Ignite:** Enemies you hit burn for additional damage over 2 seconds.

Play aggressively with Fireball (LMB) explosions and Meteor (Q) for area denial. Your burn damage adds up quickly on enemies that survive the initial hit.

---

#### Cryomancer
*Ice controller who slows enemies and detonates frost marks.*

**Passive — Frostbite:** Slowed enemies take bonus damage from your attacks.

While Cryomancer uses Mark and Detonate (see above), it plays primarily as a crowd-control caster. Frost Ray slows everything it touches, and Blizzard (Q) locks down large areas.

---

#### Arcanist
*Mobile mage with homing projectiles and teleportation.*

**Passive — Arcane Echo:** Hits have a 25% chance to automatically fire a bonus primary attack at the target.

The Arcanist is pure mobility. Blink (RMB) for repositioning, homing Arcane Bolts for consistent damage without precise aim, and Barrage (Q) for burst. Your Echo passive rewards high fire rates.

---

#### Paladin
*Holy support who heals allies, marks enemies, and detonates for burst healing.*

**Passive — Aura of Light:** Your nearby ally regenerates 2 HP per second.

While Paladin uses Mark and Detonate (see above), the core identity is support. Shield your ally with Holy Shield (RMB), mark enemies with Smite (LMB), then Consecrate (Q) to damage enemies and heal your team simultaneously.

---

#### Druid
*Nature summoner with melee sweeps, root zones, and a wolf companion.*

**Passive — Regrowth:** Regenerate 1 HP every 7 seconds.

A durable hybrid who fights at close range with Thorn Swipe (LMB), locks down areas with Entangle (RMB), and summons a Spirit Wolf (Q) for extra damage. Steady and straightforward.

---

#### Engineer
*Turret builder who controls zones with deployable constructs and mines.*

**Passive — Overclock:** Your turrets fire 20% faster.

Place turrets with Deploy Turret (RMB), scatter mines with Mine Field (Q), and poke with homing Wrench Throw (LMB). Your power comes from your constructs, not from your own attacks.

---

#### Architect
*Zone controller who builds fortifications and fights from within them.*

**Passive — Fortification:** Take 20% less damage and gain bonus mana regeneration while standing near your own zones.

Deploy Constructs (RMB) and Scatter Mines (Q) to create a fortress, then fight from inside it. Your passive rewards holding a position rather than running. Homing Arcane Bolts (LMB) let you focus on zone management instead of aiming.

---

#### Warden
*Directional shield tank who body-blocks for allies.*

**Passive — Sentinel:** Take 20% less damage from enemies you are facing. Enemies that attack you in melee are marked, causing allies to deal bonus damage to them.

The Warden plants between danger and their ally. Use Bastion (RMB) to create a protective zone, Aegis Link (Q) to shield your partner, and Guardian Strike (LMB) to mark threats. Face your enemies — turning to run removes your damage reduction.

---

#### Invoker
*Elemental master who chains fire, ice, and lightning for combo interactions.*

**Passive — Elemental Attunement:** Enemies that are both burning and slowed take bonus damage per tick. Enemies that are both stunned and burning take double burn damage.

The Invoker rewards deliberate ability sequencing. Apply burn with Flame Bolt (LMB), slow with Frost Spike (RMB), then stun with Storm Strike (Q) for maximum combo damage. Each element amplifies the others.

---

#### Tidecaller
*Water summoner who commands elementals and controls the battlefield with waves.*

**Passive — Rising Tide:** Each active summon grants +10% ability damage (up to 3 summons). With 2+ summons active, your slow effects are enhanced.

Summon water elementals with Q, support them with Tidal Wave (RMB) slows, and poke with homing Water Bolts (LMB). The more summons you have active, the stronger everything becomes. Play like a commander, not a gunner.

---

#### Voidweaver
*Void trapper who fills the battlefield with hazards and debuffs.*

**Passive — Entropic Decay:** Debuffed enemies take 15% more damage from all sources. Enemies that die while debuffed explode, dealing area damage to nearby enemies.

The Voidweaver is about preparation. Place Corruption Zones (RMB) at chokepoints, scatter Void Traps (Q) across approaches, and poke with Void Bolt (LMB) to apply burn and slow. Your passive makes every debuff a force multiplier for your whole team.

---

## Coming Soon

The following mechanics and class features are designed but not yet implemented:

- **Alternative Resources system** — Three classes are planned to replace standard mana with unique resources:
  - **Berserker** — Rage system (builds through combat, spent on abilities)
  - **Engineer** — Heat system (abilities generate heat; overheating locks you out temporarily)
  - **Cannoneer** — Ammo system (limited shots with reloads instead of mana costs)

- **Necromancer Stance Switching** — Shadow Mage (ranged) and Death Knight (melee) forms, similar to Hexblade's form system

- **Berserker Channeled Ultimate** — Blood Rage will require a 1.5s channeled wind-up before activation

- **Cannoneer Channeled Ultimate** — Artillery Barrage will root the Cannoneer for 4 seconds while firing long-range sniper shots
